# Production Prototyping

Whilst at Microsoft Research Cambridge I worked with the team that develop .NET Gadgeteer, Microsoftâ€™s new rapid hardware prototyping platform.

Using Gadgeteer, I developed DMX and MIDI production modules, enabling rapid prototyping of performance and production technology.

Prototypes were tested in a day-long workshop organised in a local theater.
