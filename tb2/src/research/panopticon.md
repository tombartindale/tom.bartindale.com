# Panopticon Editor and API

[Panopticon](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/publicweb/panopticon/) is a video overview technique developed at Newcastle University. I developed a web-api and software editing tools based on the technique to facilitate rapid trimming of video footage by non-professional editors using touch-screen interfaces.

Time-based metadata is overlaid spatially onto the media to aid in making trim decisions.

Technologies:

- PHP, C
- WPF / dotNET
