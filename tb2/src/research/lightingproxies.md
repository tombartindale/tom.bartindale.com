# Tangible Lighting Proxies

Tangible lighting proxies are physical objects used to represent and interact with stage lighting equipment in a classroom setting, facilitating a transition from abstract concepts to practical skills. They are designed to mimic the configuration, interaction, and optical properties of real stage lights, allowing students to learn lighting techniques using readily available, portable, and wirelessly controlled devices. A "broker" acts as a bridge between the proxies and industry-standard lighting controllers, enabling seamless integration with both software and hardware.
