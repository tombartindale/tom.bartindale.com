# Bicara

Bicara is a web-based one-to-one video telehealth system designed to reduce cognitive load to clients and clinicians whilst maintaining empathetic connection.

A typical Bicara session involves:

A coach schedules a session with a client in Bicara, selecting a **session template** to use for the session; at the time of the session, the coach view the **preparation screen** for the client, viewing metadata and snippets from previous sessions; the client receives an email reminder and joins the session in their web-browser; the coach runs the session, controlling **pre-prepared content**, entering **notes and meta-data into slides** and marking **interesting points for review**, via their dashboard; when the session is complete, the coach is presented with **suggestions for segments of the recording to share** with the client, they tweak a couple of them and add additional tags, and share them with the client; the client is then emailed with a magic link to view their session progress, where they can **view these snippets**.
