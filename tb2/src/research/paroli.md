# Paroli

Developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Paroli uses phone calls to support engagements with remote communities who often lack access to the Internet or strong literacy skills.

Invited participants receive a phone call from the Paroli platform, letting them join the discussion free of charge.

The only person who needs internet access is the call's host, who uses the website to manage the call through actions like muting and unmuting participants, as well as access recordings and stats from previous calls.
