# Action Translate

Action Translate is a volunteer-delivered translation experience programme linking NGOs and community organisations with volunteer translators. We work on projects to translate text-based and multimedia content such as:

- video & audio transcripts
- social media posts (captions and artwork copy)
- website copy
- evaluation reports & training materials

We combine the power of neural machine translation technology and the expertise of our volunteers through our human-in-the-loop process.

In our translation pipeline, we work closely with you in extracting the text you want to get translated from your communication materials and in putting them back together once translated.
We start our human-in-the-loop process with the use of industry standard machine translation services.
We then improve the accuracy of its output with a 2-layered verification process beginning with a post-editing verification step completed by our volunteer-translators.

Students around the world take on Action Translate projects, whether it be as part of their studies, their work integrated learning hours, or as individual volunteers. Students who have been involved with the program include Monash undergraduates, postgraduate students from Monash Interpreting and Translation Studies, and students from the University of Warwick. Action Translate provides students with learning opportunities throughout the programme, starting with training resources and supported by mentoring opportunities and peer support groups.
