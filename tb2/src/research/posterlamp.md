# PosterLamp

PosterLamp is a hardware technology that provides a visual indicator for timing quick-fire pitches during academic conference poster sessions. The lights at each poster count down until the next ‘pitch’, and time the length of the pitch. This scaffolds a physical moment of attendees around the space, as they learn to expect pitches, or avoid them. Additionally, it is used to aid volunteer film-makers who use the timers to time filming these pitches, making sure they are consistent in length, style and that everyone is captured within the presentation window.

The system has been deployed at CHI2015 and TVX2014.

Technologies:

- Custom designed and built PCBs, daisy chained and powered from one end
- DMX control software (dotNET, RaspberryPI)
