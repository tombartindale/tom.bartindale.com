# Citizen Radio

This project was an exploration into deploying community radio stations in situations where traditional radio broadcast is not possible.

Using cloud-based telephony integrating with the existing countries’ mobile phone infrastructure, we can provide small community run radio stations which broadcast through mobile phones without charge to the listener.

The role of presenter and producer is taken on by a local member of the community, usually a health-care provider who organises talk-show style shows around particular topics relevant to the local community.

This project led to further developments where we are looking into scaffolding the producer’s role further, and deploying the system into other developing environments.
