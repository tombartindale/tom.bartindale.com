# ZoomSense

We have seen a dramatic increase in the adoption of teleconferencing systems such as Zoom for remote teaching and working. Although designed primarily for traditional video conferencing scenarios, these platforms are actually being deployed in many diverse contexts.

As such, Zoom offers little to aid hosts' understanding of attendee participation and often hinders participant agency.

We introduce ZoomSense : an open-source, scalable infrastructure built upon 'virtual meeting participants', which exposes real-time meta-data, meeting content and host controls through an easy to use abstraction - so that developers can rapidly and sustainably augment Zoom.
