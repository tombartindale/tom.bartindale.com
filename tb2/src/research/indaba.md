# Indaba

Indaba is an innovative approach to supporting local communities share their stories using video. Traditionally, video production has been seen as a highly skilled endeavour and was limited to those with high media literacy. Using Indaba, a group/community/organisation can collaboratively shoot, edit and publish videos.

Indaba uses innovative features within a digitally augmented process to allow non-professionals to support community delivered media. The Indaba process works very much like a 5 day 'film school'. It takes a community through the key stages of making a video to tell their story, from ideation to production, allowing them to perform all steps along the way without content intervention by the Facilitator.

Indaba was developed within a set of core values and design principles:

- To empower the use of video as a means to support community voice.
- To support sustainable and practical use of video with communities in field contexts.
- To be Open Source, and Creative Commons in everything we do so that knowledge is shared.
