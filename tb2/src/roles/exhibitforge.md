description: "A buisness partnership that emerged from an on-going relationship with the Great North Museum: Hancock in Newcastle upon Tyne. We provide a network of technical support staff on call for exhibit maintenance, builds and installations. To facilitate this service, I develop and manage an online ticketing system for both museum and technical support staff through which problems are tracked."
