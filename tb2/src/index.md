tagline:
  I am a researcher in Human-Computer Interaction with a focus on new media production technologies and innovative interaction methods. I explore the opportunities presented by mobile computing, collaborative interaction, and novel technologies for media production and delivery.

  With hands-on experience in event management and production technologies, I envision new approaches to media consumption and creation. My research focuses on applying these technologies to support non-professional communities in sectors such as mental health, public health, international development, and higher education.
