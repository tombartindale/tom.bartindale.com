# TuneTable

TuneTable is a public interactive designed in conjunction with BBC Research as a way of introducing tangible and collaborative control to the live audio domain. It allows the public to assume the role of a music producer, controlling aspects of each of the instruments such as gain, reverb, compression and others.

These effects are represented by tangible objects that are placed on lines from the instruments to the “speaker” or output. Twisting the tangibles alters the effect.

This installation was installed in the Sage Gateshead for the [Radio 3 Free Thinking Festival 2010](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0144txn), where it was used by a wide range of ages and musical abilities.

Technologies:

- Custom built circular FTIR interface with rear-projection
- WPF / dotNET software to manipulate audio
- Reactvision tracking sofware
