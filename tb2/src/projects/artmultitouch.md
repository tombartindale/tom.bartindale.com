# Art Therapy Multi-touch

A multi-touch coffee table based on FTIR technology. Software on the table replicates real world properties of finger painting, allowing therapists to set up unsupervised sessions for people with dementia. The coffee table is similar to the Sage project, but includes a compliant surface and infrared camera in the unit.

Technologies:

- Custom built hyper-sensitive FTIR rear-projected display
- WPF / dotNET software with art applications
