# PollBook Interactive

This interactive exhibit I designed for the Great North Museum as part of an exhibit on a 1700â€™s polling book from the area. The exhibit engaged visitors with the contents of a replica book by visually detecting the current page and animating a digital representation with additional content, images and audio related to the current page.

Technologies:

- WPF / dotNET
- Reactivision tracking software
- Physical build of stand and integrated hardware
- Manufacture of visually tagged replica book
