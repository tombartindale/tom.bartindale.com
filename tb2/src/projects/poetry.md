# Tangible Poetry

An art installation in which pieces of art are tagged with markers, so that when they are placed on various areas of an interactive coffee table, related artwork, poems and audio is displayed around it. Using powered markers, the public can see content animate gently around the surface.

Technolgies:

- Custom built powered tangible objects tracked on a IR surface
- Rear-projected display
- WPF / dotNET
