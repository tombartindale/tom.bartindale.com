# OpenTally

In a world where your live broadcast is now run from a Zoom meeting or your local coffee shop and your guests are across the world, we need a flexible tally light system that responds to changing scenarios.

OpenTally supports:

- OBS (software) or Black Magic ATEM mixers can be used as the tally source.
- Any combination of web or hardware tally lights can be used simultaneously.
- Web tally can be used from a remote location (e.g. at the remote end of a Zoom call connected to an ATEM switcher)
